title: Good programmers write code - Great programmers face its consequences

It goes without saying that techies are highly opinionated about a lot of technical concepts or paradigms.


Wait! Am I strongly opinionated here?


Anyway, that is not the point of this write-up. 



Many people write "clean code",  "dirty code" or whatever that is called, forgetting that coding is all about trade-offs.


A lot of beginner software developers are too dogmatic about some concepts because their role models use them without considering the trade-offs such role models chose willingly.


Whenever you write code, whether it is meant to solve a technical problem or others, you have to expect its concequeences -- good or bad.

When you write clean code some other things suffer just like how some things suffer when you write "dirty code".


Some innocent coders, based on all they have read, think once you have written "clean code" everything is alright but we have learnt the hard way that there is always more to writing "clean" or "dirty" code (If there is anything like these).


There are consequences.


It is one thing to write code; it is another thing to face the consequences of whatever written.


In an attempt to face such consequences, a lot of great concepts have been provided.


Some provided DRY, WET, TDD or Clean Code to reduce the  consequences of the code written.


Many software developers have forgotten that our coded solutions also come with their own consequences.


The only code with no consequences, in programming context, is unwritten code.


So, software developers must always be on the look out for the consequences of the code written.


Good software engineers write code, great software engineers face its consequences.
