It is very common for beginner software developers to be confused about the tech-stack to learn.


At least, I was confused.


And I post this article to help you pick what to learn to help you avoid confusion to some extent. Below are steps to help you pick tech-stacks to learn in 2020 without stress.


# 1. Get Rid of All the Noise in your Head. 


You have heard or read a lot of things that are affecting your choice. 


PHP is dead!

Python is a bae!

Java is enterprise!

JavaScript is weird!


All these make it difficult for you to choose what to learn easily. So you are confused.


To reduce your confusion level, clear your head and empty your mind.


It is easier said than done but you have to do it anyway because it the starting point of getting rid of most of the common problems beginner software developers are facing.



# 2. Know Your Purpose: 


Many beginners want to learn coding because of some perceived benefits. So, they are in a hurry to get the benefits but they are confused because they don't go about it the "right" way.


The first thing to do is to ignore those benefits and ask yourself:


why do I want to learn? 


Is it to get a Job (work for companies) or make things (work for myself directly)?


Then, you will be clear about the next step to take. Even if you are not clear about your next step, don't panic because we have got you covered. 


Keep on reading!


# 3. What "Platform" Do I Like to Work With? 


It is very important to be clear about the platform you want to work with to be less confused.


Is it?


1. Web 
2. Mobile
3. Machine Learning
4. Virtual Reality 
6. Security
5. Or others.


Then Pick One "Platform" You Love.


#4. Picking A Programming Language/Framework.


If I want to work for companies and I like to work as a web developer, the next move is to look for international, local and remote job's requirements.


Then look for recurring stacks with little things to learn.


Note the recurring stacks with Notion or Habitica. Just make sure you keep a record of recurring stacks. Then...


#5. Going Specific:


You maybe confused because there are a lot to learn. 


Therefore, I would ask myself again: 


Is it possible to specialise to reduce the number of things to learn?


Frontend or Backend. 


Then, check job's requirements for each of them. 


Rinse & repeat.


#6. Then Pull the Trigger:


Pick a programming language/framework you feel is widely used in your field or the one that makes most money based on your findings.


That is your choice because everything comes with it's downside.


So, be ready for the consequences of your choice.


# . Case Two: Working Directly For Yourself.


You will still use the same methodology but in this case, you may need to check freelance websites and have additional skills like selling, marketing, networking, emotional intelligence and all those business stuff.
