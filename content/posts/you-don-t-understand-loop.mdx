#Do you really understand loop?

We all use for, do while, while and other forms of loop, but do we really understand them?

#What is loop?

Loop is a structure, series, or process, the end of which is connected to the beginning.

This means that when a loop comes to an end, it goes back to the beginning. In short, it repeats a process over and over again based on given conditions.

#Examples of loop in the real world. 

1. Day and Night
2. Living 
3. Sleeping and Waking 
4. Eating 

#Major forms of loop

A loop can be finite if it ends without external interruption, that is, it is self-terminable or has known end.

E.g Living as a human being. 

A loop can be infinite if it ends only with external interruption. It is not self-terminable. 

E.g Human Existence.

Things that use loop are all around. We all loop things everyday. As you put spoon in your mouth repetitively, you make use of loop.

What are the things that use loop around you?
