**WAIT!** In case you just want to quickly play with React, check out [Here](#)


What you would learn in this part of the tutorial:

    Installation of React with create-react-app.

The first thing you have to do is to download nodejs from [Here - download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then, install it..

To confirm if nodejs has been installed, search git (or cmd) on you computer, if found; launch it. Once you have launched it, run:

node -v

and it should show the version of nodejs that is available on your computer e.g v10.14.2.
But wait! How do I install React?

## Method 1:

Run the command below in your git to install react.

```
npx create-react-app api-consumer
```

This code would create a react application named api-consumer in the directory you specified. NPX is not a typo, it is a package runner that comes with nodejs.

## Method 2: 

**Another way to install react applications with create-react-app.**

You might have seen some tutorials in which create-react-app is installed before creating a react application.

Good! That is another way to install a react application with create-react-app. Below is how to do it:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Above command will install create-react-app globally on you computer. Any time you want to create a react application, you just need to run:

```
create-react-app your-react-app-name
```

For example

```
create-react-app api-consumer
```

The above code should create api-consumer in the directory you specified, just like the first method. Also, be informed that both Method 1 and Method 2 will create the same thing, so you need to use one of the two (not both of them).

Before running any of above code, you must have installed Node >= 6 and npm >= 5.2 on your machine. Don’t forget!

To start the react application, run:

cd api-consumer
npm start

That is how to install a React application. Thanks for reading.
