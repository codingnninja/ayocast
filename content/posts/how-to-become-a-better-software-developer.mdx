Wow! 


I love the fact that you want to become a better software developer and having such desire and the willingness to achieve it are probably the most important requirements. 


You can definitely become a better software developer if you can give whatever it takes. You don't have to be qualified yet. 


Many respected software developers were also not qualified to get to their current level until they solved some problems that validated them.


You can also repeat the process and become a better software developer if you can:


#ðŸ’¥ Focus on Things That Matter.


Many people can't focus on things that matter to them because they are not intentional about things that matter to them.


Everything goes! Is that your approach?


You can't focus on things you don't know.


The first thing to do is to identify what you care about as a software engineer.


Don't be distracted or discouraged by the learning ability of your friend that learnt JavaScript faster than you.


It doesn't matter.


Don't feel incompetent because of the success of someone who is not as skilful as you are. 


It doesn't matter.


What matters is your purpose.


You need to identify what you want and the process to achieve them then you will be less concerned about focusing on other's problem or success.


My skills can't make you a better software developer, practise to develop yours.ðŸ˜Ž


#ðŸ’¥ Be Confident of Yourself: Nobody is Perfect.


It is easy to be intimidated by other's intelligence, skills or success. 


Don't look down on yourself because others are better. They are not perfect so raise your voice or code your own way and see its consequence.


Don't be afraid of being wrong, just be ready to learn fast.


When you find out you are wrong, self-correct. Progress of most great software developers you know is based on their belief in themselves and abilities to learn from mistakes.


You can't choose to approach things from another angle if you don't believe in your abilities. Believe in your abilities to discover a programming approach that can save the world. 


Then, practise!


You can't change the world if you don't believe in yourself


#ðŸ’¥ Solve Problems that Matter.


No one has ever been great without solving problems that matter to a set of people in History. You are probably reading this write-up because it matters to you


You can't be better by wishing. You have to get things done. Things that you and others care about.


Many great software developers you respect were able to get to their current level because they decided to solve some problems they were not qualified to solve but they solved the problems in the end.


You can do the same!


#ðŸ’¥ Learn things that matter:


You need to learn several debugging approaches and pick the one that makes you better or make a better approach by combining them.


When  I watch people code, I try learning their debugging approaches because debugging can make or break a software developer.


Learn the basics of your tools. Improve your understanding of the part of your tools that are always handy in solving most of your programming challenges. Learning the basics makes the secondary journey less difficult.


Learn things that matter. Be reasonably curious!


#ðŸ’¥ Be Patient:


"With patience, you can cook a stone".(Nigerian Proverb)


Sometimes, things would not go as you planned. Expected results may not be satisfactory. You may not be able to learn as fast as you think! You may not be able to summon the courage to act on your beliefs.


It is okay. 


Just be patient! Patience is one of the hardest skills to acquire in life.


There were times I blamed myself for learning to code because I couldn't understand anything. There were times I almost lost hope because I couldn't get desired results. 


Looking backwards, I can easily connect the dots. Don't be too hard on yourself because others are moving faster or getting better results.


It is okay to re-evaluate yourself to see if you can correct your approach or something but not to the extent of losing hope.


It is better to focus on things that matter. Be patient and you will get there. It is a matter of time.


#ðŸ’¥ Make Sure You Don't Give Up until it is Necessary.


From my personal experience, I have learnt that we give up too early and that is why we are not able to be better programmers.


It is easy to say a programming language is difficult. It is easy to condemn a concept without using it.


My hack, in this case, is assuming that I am not smart enough to understand but not because a programming language is hard. This mindset helps me focus on how to learn better instead of complaining about how hard things are.


Things would always be hard; you just have to focus on making them easy. Having a belief that the challenges you face are all about you but not the programming language prepares your mind to withstand programming challenges.


And you will be able to keep trying without giving up until it is necessary.


#ðŸ’¥ Have your Own Mind.


To be a great software developer, adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.


I know you think you can't contribute to the programming world because you are not that skilful or an authority.


But you can't become an authority by wishing. You can only become so by contributing.


Most great developers also feel they are not as good as people think but they do not focus on that feeling. They focus on contributing and boom, they hit it. 


Make things!


If you discover something new or important, contribute it no matter how small it is. You don't have to change the world, just try to solve problems that matter.


And spreading your approach might be a solution, you never know.


#ðŸ’¥ Practise! Practise and practise.


Becoming a better software developer is not about wishing to become one, it is about doing the work.


Practising helps you discover challenges that can turn you to a better software developer if you make sure you solve them. 


Keep practising!
