It is common for software developers to visit documentations from time to time. It is a normal practice you cannot avoid no matter how smart you are.

So, it is good you have the react documentation and others offline to avoid using the internet always, especially if you are from a country where data is expensive.

Ok! How can I use React documentation offline?

Click [download Zealdocs](https://zealdocs.org/download.html) to download Zealdocs and install it. After installing Zealdocs, click on the Docsets: Install and update docsets. It should look like the image below.

A dialog box will pop up. Click available button: documentations for many languages and frameworks will appear, look for react and double click to install it. Once you do that, you can now read react documentation without the internet.

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! That is a good thing.

That is how to install react and other documentations offline.

Good luck!
